Detecting and Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Automatic Testing


Recording Test with Selenium IDE

- The browser opened via Selenium IDE is the same zoom as your current browser

- The size of the browser opened via Selenium IDE seems to be consistent, but that could just be for my screen size. Requires testing with different sized screens to be sure.


Post IDE Thoughts

- There are a lot of mouse clicks to be recorded, so this will be a good test to determine the accuracy of the recorded mouse coordinates and the accuracy of perform_action.

- Longer "golden" script than what we've been working with, so it'll be a good test to see how consistently prompt_user and the additions to make_enhanced work as intended


Recording User Input

- The browser opened with make_enhanced is defaulted to 100% zoom, regardless of what your browser is set to or what zoom the test was initially recorded in. This is nice in terms of consistency, but it also means that scrolling will be more common than if you were zoomed out, which can and will lead to incorrect mouse coordinates

- Due to the default zoom, scrolling was required when interacting with the VM to avoid crashing.
	- This is due to the fact that the generated script by Selenium IDE clicks on the center of the canvas whenever any form of interaction with it shows up. If the center of the canvas is not on the screen, then the script crashes.

- We may want to consider tacking on a "wait" somewhere in perform_action since any lab that interacts with a browser wil have to wait at least a little bit for things to load before moving on. As it currently is, it's likely the test script will just click in the indicated places as soon as it's able, which will lead to click incorrectly.


Examining Created Test Script

- Everything is added as recorded, which is great

- Mouse coordinates were passed and show up in the test script correctly. Same with any continues that were recorded.

- The keyboard input may not be recorded correctly if certain keys are pressed during it. I have not narrowed it down, but, as of right now, I am assuming that any key that is not a letter breaks the keyboard input part of prompt_user and returns an empty string as a default.
	- This will make things such as deleting or replacing text difficult or impossible to do currently


Running the Generated Test Script

- Due to the fact that scrolling is required when recording user inputs, it is nearly impossible to tell, currently, whether a mouse click is missing the target, or if it just isn't going through.
	- Have looked into manually adjusting the zoom of the browser by inserting a line at the beginning of the script, but that has, so far, just instantly crashed the script
