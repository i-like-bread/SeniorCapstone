# Read the Golden Script one line at a time.
# For each line your read write it verbatim to the Enhanced Script file.
# If the line you read starts with # nn where nn is a number,
# write this line to the Enhanced Script file.
# Then write to the file the statement print(prompt_user()).
# Make sure the line you add is indented correctly.
# Manually edit the Enhanced Script to add import team3module
