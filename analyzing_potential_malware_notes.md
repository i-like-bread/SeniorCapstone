Analyzing Potential Malware Automated Testing Notes


Recording Test with Selenium IDE

- The browser opened via Selenium IDE is the same zoom as your current browser

- The size of the browser opened via Selenium IDE seems to be consistent, but that could just be for my screen size. Requires testing with different sized screens to be sure.


Post IDE Thoughts

- There is a lot of keyboard input required, at least initially, so this will test that aspect of prompt_user well

- Longer "golden" script than what we've been working with, so it'll be a good test to see how consistently prompt_user and the additions to make_enhanced work as intended


Recording User Input

- The browser opened with make_enhanced is defaulted to 100% zoom, regardless of what your browser is set to or what zoom the test was initially recorded in. This is nice in terms of consistency, but it also means that scrolling will be more common than if you were zoomed out, which can and will lead to incorrect mouse coordinates

- Due to the default zoom, scrolling was required when interacting with the VM to avoid crashing.
	- This is due to the fact that the generated script by Selenium IDE clicks on the center of the canvas whenever any form of interaction with it shows up. If the center of the canvas is not on the screen, then the script crashes.

- Anything that requires scrolling in the VM will be hard, if not impossible, to interact with currently. We have no ways to capture scrolling as of now.

- A way to deal with accidental errors, such as key presses, would be nice, but not required


Examining Created Test Script

- Everything is added as recorded, which is great

- Mouse coordinates were passed and show up in the test script correctly. Same with any continues that were recorded.

- Only the first of the keyboard inputs was recorded correctly. The others all show up as empty strings.
	- Further inspection shows that, even in the recording in enhanced.py, only the first keyboard input was recorded correctly and all others after it were recorded as empty strings.


Running the Generated Test Script

- Due to the fact that scrolling is required when recording user inputs, it is nearly impossible to tell, currently, whether a mouse click is missing the target, or if it just isn't going through.
	- Have looked into manually adjusting the zoom of the browser by inserting a line at the beginning of the script, but that has, so far, just instantly crashed the script
